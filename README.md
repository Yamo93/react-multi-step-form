# A Multi-Step-Form made with React and Firebase
I created a multi-step form with React and Firebase. I used CSS modules for the styling too. I was initially inspired by Brad Traversy (TraversyMedia @ YouTube), but I implemented the UI and the functionality on my own.
I used React and SASS mixed with CSS Modules for the interface. I also integrated a Firebase DB with the Axios package, sending post and get requests to the server and retrieving the data. The user info is actually saved on the Firebase backend.
